# Douglas Quintanilha's dotfiles

The goal of this repository is to save and share my dotfiles.

I use the [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) tool to manage them.

To install the dotfiles, simply do `./install`.

This is the initial version, with very minimum configs and files, and the goal is to evolve them overtime.
