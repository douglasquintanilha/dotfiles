# Douglas Quintanilha's dotfiles

The goal of it's repository is to save and share my dotfiles.

I use the [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) tool to manage them.

To install, simply do `./install`

This is the initial version, with very minimum configs and files, and the goal is to evolve them overtime.
